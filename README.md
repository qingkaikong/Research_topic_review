# Research_topic_review
This folder will contain the review of the research literature review that I interested, mainly in Seismology. I think this is also a good way to learn a certain topic. I will read the important papers in the topic, and write down the summary and point the references in the review, so that I can easily find the topic history and rough progress later. I will try to put here only the important references. Some of these maybe not correct, but hope in the future, someone can correct me after I finish.
